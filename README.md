**Dōkutsu** (洞窟) is a handcrafted 2D dungeon action game written in modern C++ with SDL2. Players explore a hostile, monster-infested world (soon-to-be cave system), wielding weapons and magic to survive and grow stronger.

## Map System

The game loads static tiles and enemies from CSV map layouts:
- `map/map_FloorBlocks.csv` – boundaries
- `map/map_Grass.csv` – decorative and collidable tiles
- `map/map_Objects.csv` – obstacles
- `map/map_Entities.csv` – players and enemies
